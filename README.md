# code_quiz
The goal of this project was to implement a multiple choice quiz where particapants are asked some basic questions pertaining to JavaScript. The goal was to have a "Begin" button 
visible to visitors immediately upon opening the site. When this button is clicked, a timer starts and the quiz begins! The console logs the participants questions and when 
they reach the end of the game, if they have reached a high score, their name and score is recorded. 

I had a very difficult week in my personal life and so was not able to dedicate as much time to this project as I usually am able to. There is no timer, no "Begin" button, and 
no function to record and store the high scores and player names. The buttons are not properly configured; the goal of the project was to have a new question pop up as soon as the 
old question is answered. In its current iteration, the player is required to click the "next" button to proceed to a new question. 

I hope to resubmit later in the week with the site vastly improved. I am almost embarassed to turn this in but I figured it would be better to turn in what I have.
